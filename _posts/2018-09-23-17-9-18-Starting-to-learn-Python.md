  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Not knowing what Python is.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To learn what Python does and do some basic coding using Python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I know what Python is and can do some basic lines of code.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I didn't know how to calculate the remainder for a division sum on Python so I worked out that by adding the answer to the remainder you get the remainder. Also, I didn’t press the hint button once.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself why my table for my blog wasn’t wide then I realised it was because I hadn’t added width 100%.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independence by not letting the website help me by me pressing the solution button as I wanted to work it out by myself because it is a lot more satisfying.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on a line of code in Python and why it wasn’t working then realised it was because I hadn’t added speech marks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was engaged by trying to work through the Python course and not stopping until the end of the lesson so I could get as much done as possible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I maybe could have got a bit further in the Python course as I only go to the question where you have to calculate the annual rainfall that year.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will read through the column that tells you what to do a lot more carefully as this will speed up my learning.</td>
