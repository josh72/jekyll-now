  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>My background image wasn't working and I had to try multiple to fix it until I finally realised I had missed brackets and speech marks in my code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself how to use text shadow but had forgotten so I searched it up on w3schools.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I didn’t know how to change the font style to italic so I looked it up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on my coding and thought about how I could make it better then added a table.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I looked on w3schools to figure out how to put a border on my table and engaged in the task to successfully add a table.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could’ve read the information on w3schools more carefully rather than skim reading it then looking at the code. This would have meant I would have made less mistakes and therefore would be quicker.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will read the entire bit of information carefully so I don’t make as many mistakes.</td>
